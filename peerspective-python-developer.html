# Backend or Full Stack
Looking for backend and full stack python developers

We are working with one of the fastest growing startups in the UK to find a Full Stack Python developer or a purely Backend Python developer

They are very much focused around the right people not just their technical ability.

## Overview of responsibilities:
- Craft intelligently responsive front-end user experiences that work across devices using semantic well-structured HTML, CSS (SCSS) and JavaScript
- Build robust backend services as part of our event-driven architecture
- Collaborate in autonomous squads to deliver high impact features that our customers love
- Lead best practices ensuring appropriate testing and great software engineering
- Contribute, both in ideas and execution, to the ongoing evolution of the platform architecture
- Guiding and mentoring other members of the team, sharing knowledge and challenging appropriately
- Refine the skills and techniques necessary to take the next step in your career, whether thatâ€™s leading a team, architecting complex systems or just being the best developer you can be
## Tech Stack

- Python (Flask + SQLAlchemy + Celery) with some Go, Redis, DynamoDB, MySQL and S3 for data storage. 

- On the frontend - clean, modern HTML5, Sass-powered CSS and cruft-free JavaScript.

The platform is comprised of resilient and scalable applications and services powered by AWS with a mixture of Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, CloudFormation and EC2 Container Service (introducing Kubernetes with EKS).
